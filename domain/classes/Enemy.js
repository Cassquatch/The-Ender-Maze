/**
 * Will come back to this, just scaffolding out some stuff. Need to create an enemy class, that takes in an enemy name as a parameter(like goblin, dragon, etc) then also take in the user's level on the current character as a parameter, then perform a switch statement to see the level range the user is in, and based on user level, randomly generate the enemies stats
